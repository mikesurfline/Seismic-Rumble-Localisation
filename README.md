This repository contains all code and data to re-produce results and figures from the scientific article "Seismic localisation of elephant rumbles as a monitoring approach" by Michael Reinwald et al.

To make this tool more accessible to other researchers we are implementing a more stand-alone version and improvement to the code in the development branch.
